# SummonMechanicProj

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

A small project with the goal of learning Artificial Intelligence and Montage manipulation to create an interactive combat system designed around player self-expression.

Players are able to capture enemy stats during attacks to re-summon the enemy at a later point mid-attack for a combat advantage.
